## Automated Personal Tax Preparing Tool for VMW-AVGO Merger

This is a Python-based tool that automatically calculates the cost basis of the VMW-AVGO merger. It can generate all
data without the need for manually inputting per-lot information; you just need to download two files from E*Trade.

This tool processes the Gain&Loss file downloaded from E*TRADE. For each row (lot), it generates tax information,
including the cost basis for cash received during the merger as well as for converted AVGO shares. Additionally,
it calculates the cost basis for AVGO cash-in-lieu fractional shares and provides a tax summary across all lots.

The tool supports VMW shares acquired via ESPP, RSU, NSO, and brokerage purchases, as well as VMW shares sold before
and on the merger date.

Note:
This tool is applicable only to US holders of VMware shares. It appears that non-US holders have received the cash
component as a dividend instead of a share sale, leading to substantially different implications for tax computation.

## USAGE

```text
usage: tax.py [-h] [-c CASH] [-s STOCK] [-q] input output

positional arguments:
  input                     gain&loss csv file path
  output                    output file path, without file extension

options:
  -h, --help                show this help message and exit
  -c CASH, --cash CASH      vmware share count liquidated for cash
  -s STOCK, --stock STOCK   vmware share count liquidated for stock
  -q, --qualifying          force espp lot to use qualifying disposition, default to false
```

#### Usage example

```text
cd tax-tool
python3 tax.py gain-loss.csv output -c 459 -s 500 -q
```

#### Prepare Input Parameter

- Gain&Loss file: from E*TRADE website, select `Stock Plan (AVGO) ACCOUNT` -> `My Account` tab -> `Gains&Losses` ->
  click `Download`. Either `Download Collapsed` or `Download Expanded` are ok.
    - A xlsx file will be downloaded.
    - Open it in Excel, Numbers, or Google Sheets and save/download it as a CSV file. Choose the
      `Comma Separated Values` option if applicable.
    - If you're using macOS, use Numbers instead of Microsoft Excel to export the .xlsx file as a CSV.
- VMware share count liquidated for cash & stock: from E*TRADE website, select `Stock Plan (AVGO) ACCOUNT` ->
  `Tax Information` tab -> `statements` -> download 12/31/2023 `Single Account Statement`. On the last page of this
  statement:
    - find row with `UNACCEPTED SHARES` comments, the `Quantity` number is the share count liquidated for cash
    - find row with `TENDER PAYMERNT` comments, the `Quantity` number is the share count liquidated for stock
- `-q` option: please refer to the section titled `Potential AVGO Cost Base Adjustment For Last ESPP Lot`

#### Handle Shares Acquired Through Brokerage Purchase

Shares acquired through brokerage purchases will not be included in the downloaded Gain&Loss file. Users can create
their own Gain&Loss file by making a copy of the downloaded one and wiping out the existing content except the
header. Then, manually enter purchase information into this new Gain&Loss file, allocating one row per transaction.
The following columns need to be populated:

- Record Type: `Sell`
- Symbol: `VMW`
- Plan Type: `BUY`
- QTY.: `<number of shares>`
- Date Acquired: `<purchase date>`
- Acquisition Cost: `<total purchase price including commission>`
- Date Sold: `11/22/2023` or earlier.
- Total Proceeds: `<total proceeds reported by 1099-B>`

The command-line inputs `-c` and `-s` are used to calculate the precise cash/stock allocation ratio. If you can
determine the `-c` and `-s` values, enter them in the command line as usual. Otherwise, you can skip these optional
parameters, and the script will use the default ratio of 0.479 for cash and 0.521 for stock, respectively.
The -q option is not needed, as these are not ESPP shares.

#### Output

This tool generates two files: one in text format and another with the same name in CSV format. Both files contain tax
information for each lot. Additionally, the text file contains tax summary across all lots and AVGO cash-in-lieu
fractional share information. In the generated files, each lot has a "Row ID" field, which corresponds to the ID of
the corresponding row from the Gain&Loss input file. This correlation allows for easy matching between computed lots
from the output and reported lots from the input.

#### Turbo Tax Filing

For each stock transaction reported on Form 1099-B, locate the corresponding row (lot) in the generated tax file by
acquisition date and share count.

- Use `Box 1d Proceeds` value generated by script to populate Turbo Tax `Box 1d - Proceeds` field. If you already
  imported from E*TRADE, verify value generated by script matches imported one.
- Use `Filing Cost Basis` value generated by script to populate Turbo Tax `Cost basis or adjusted cost basis` field

#### Potential AVGO Cost Base Adjustment For Last ESPP Lot

The generated AVGO cost basis can be used as is, except for the last ESPP lot acquired on 08/31/2022, which is the
only one with a disqualifying disposition as of the merge date. Its ESPP disposition status will transition to
qualifying after 03/01/2024. If you didn't sell the converted AVGO shares of that lot before 03/01/2024, include `-q`
as a command line input, which will force the ESPP to be considered as a qualifying disposition. This adjustment will
result in AVGO shares of this lot having a more favorable (higher) cost basis.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- [Q] My lot cost base is still 0, is this expected?
  Yes, the merge transaction is different from a normal sale. In general, if the VMW cost basis is lower than $128
  per share, the cost basis is 0. Please refer to the following link for guidelines on computing the
  `filing cost base`: https://investors.broadcom.com/static-files/7720c4c1-c940-4d9d-800c-66819bfdc7a0,
