## Automated Personal Tax Preparing Tool for VMware Acquisition

This is a python based tool aimed at auto generating cost base for current tax year filing and adjust AVGO share
cost base to ease future tax year filing.

This tool processes Gain & Loss file downloaded from ETRADE. It generates tax info for each row(lot). It also generates
tax summary across all lots and AVGO cash in lieu fractional share info if applicable.

## USAGE

```text
usage: tax.py [-h] [-c CASH] [-s STOCK] input output

positional arguments:
  input                     gain & loss csv file path
  output                    output file path, without file extension

options:
  -h, --help                show this help message and exit
  -c CASH, --cash CASH      vmware share count liquidated for cash
  -s STOCK, --stock STOCK   vmware share count liquidated for stock
```

#### Usage example

```text
cd tool-dir
python tax.py gain-loss.csv output -c 459 -s 500
```

#### Prepare Input Parameter

- Gain & Loss file: from ETRADE website, select `Stock Plan (AVGO) ACCOUNT` -> `My Account` tab -> `Gains & Losses` ->
  click `Download`. Either `Download Collapsed` or `Download Expanded` are ok. 
    - A xlsx file will be downloaded.
    - Open it in Excel or Numbers or Google Sheet and save/download it as csv file.
- VMware share count liquidated for cash & stock: from ETRADE website, select `Stock Plan (AVGO) ACCOUNT` ->
  `Tax Information` tab -> `statements` -> download 12/31/2023 Single Account Statement. On the last page of this
  statement:
    - find row with `UNACCEPTED SHARES` comments, the `Quantity` number is the share count liquidated for cash
    - find row with `TENDER PAYMERNT` comments, the `Quantity` number is the share count liquidated for stock

#### Output

This tool generates two files, one in text format, another with the same name in csv format. Both files contain
tax info for each lot, in addition, the text file contains tax summary cross all lots and AVGO cash in lieu fractional
share info. In generated files, each lot has a row id field which is id of the corresponding row from Gain & Loss input
file, so we can easily correlate between computed lot from output and reported lot from input.

#### Turbo Tax Filing

For each stock transaction reported on 1099-B, find the corresponding row(lot) in generated tax file by acquire date and 
share count.
- Use `Box 1d Proceeds` value generated by script to populate Turbo Tax `Box 1d - Proceeds` field. If you already 
imported from ETRADE, verify value generated by script matches imported one.
- Use `Filing Cost Basis` value generated by script to populate Turbo Tax `Cost basis or adjusted cost basis` field

#### Potential AVGO Cost Base Adjustment For Last ESPP Lot

Generated AVGO cost base can be used as is except the last ESPP lot, which is the only one with disqualifying
disposition. If AVGO shares from that lot are sold after 03/01/2024, its ESPP disposition status will be transitioned 
to qualifying. To reflect this change, we could modify input csv file, set corresponding `Date Sold` value to reflect 
actual sold date, then rerun the tool.
